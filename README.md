## Important Notice

### Deposit Protocol Enforcement

CoinBot enforces **strict deposit validation rules** to ensure system integrity and operational safety.

**Deposits below the minimum threshold are automatically rejected and are not recoverable.**

The CoinBot frontend prevents low-value transactions by design. Any attempt to bypass these safeguards—whether through direct API calls or payload manipulation—will result in the transaction being discarded at the backend level. Discarded transactions are not recorded by the system, and any associated funds cannot be refunded.

## 1. Deposit Limits & Data Integrity

To maintain system efficiency and consistency, all deposits are subject to protocol validation.

* **Minimum Deposit:** $100.00 USD (or equivalent)

* **Enforcement:** Invalid or manipulated requests are rejected without recovery

Users are responsible for ensuring that all deposits comply with these requirements.
