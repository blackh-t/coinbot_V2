# Service Policy & Terms of Service
**Last Updated:** December 2025

> [!CAUTION]
> ### 🔴 IMPORTANT: DEPOSIT PROTOCOL
> **Deposits below the defined limit constitute a "False Packet."**
>
> These transactions will be rejected by the system logic and are **NOT RECOVERABLE**.
>
> The application frontend employs a "Panic" state to block low-value transactions. If a user attempts to bypass this via API manipulation, the backend will discard the data packet. Funds attached to discarded packets are not registered and **cannot be refunded**.
